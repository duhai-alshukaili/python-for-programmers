* Wednesday: 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM (Room: A112)

## Course Information
*Python for Programmers* is intended for those with some programming experience. The course will discuss topics necessary for the participants to be able to create and execute Python programs. The material presented will provide knowledge and skills to students that serve as a foundation for continued learning of given areas.
The class will use the  [Python 3.7 programming language](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/).

## Readings
The textbooks for this course are [Programming in Python 3: A Complete Introduction to the Python Language (PIP)](https://github.com/duhai-alshukaili/python-for-programmers/blob/master/books/ProgrammingInPython3.pdf) by Mark Summerfield and [RealPython Part 1: Introduction to Python (RP1)](https://github.com/duhai-alshukaili/python-for-programmers/blob/master/books/RealPythonPart1.pdf). These books cover in details the topics of the course.

## Required Software
To learn python, most likely you will need to install a python environment. For this course, we will use 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which a free and open-source distribution of the python (and R) programming language. 
Therefore, make sure to [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) the **Python 3.7** version of Anaconda to work 
with the exercises and activities that come with this course.

Alternatively, you can download the [python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from the official home of the python language. If you go with this
option, I will recommend that you download programmer-friendly text editor to write a python script. I suggest that you go
with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

### Python IDEs
For simple scripting and for interactive programming, the above software will be sufficient. However, if you need to work
with large projects in pythons, e.g. Web applications, then you may think of using an IDE. Here are two of my favourite options:

* In my opinion, the best Python IDE is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). It is perhaps, the only fully-featured IDE that is designed to work with python. It comes under three flavours: [Professional (paid)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), 
[Community (Free)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), and [Educational (Free)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/). 
Note that [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) provides [free individual licenses for students and faculty members](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
which can be used to obtain the professional editions free of charge.  

* The second best option is to get use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) with [PyDev Plugin](http://www.pydev.org/).

To learn more about the different options of IDEs check [RealPython's Guide to IDEs and Code Editors.](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/)
